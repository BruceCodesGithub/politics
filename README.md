# Political things

This is a beta-project for a political-related website. 

## Purpose

The goal is to create a website and forum for politics. A place where users and fact-check can discuss and share their knowledge about politics. Politicians often make fake promises and say stupid stuff, like all the time. This can be a place where people can point out the lies and make their own conclusions.

## Goals

- [ ] A "promise tracker" that informs the users of the promises made vs the promises kept by the government.
- [ ] A forum for users to discuss political events.
- [ ] Polls.
- [ ] A news feed of the latest events.
- [ ] Profile Pages for major politicians and political parties.

## Contributing

This project is about a website, but sadly I am not familiar with web-developing or javascript. All contributions and suggestions are welcome. 

You could contribute by creating a pull request to suggest code changes, or start an issue to give me advice.
